/**
 * RESEARCH WAVE 11 - FOUR THESES IN ONE WAVE (EVs, newer vehicles, top sellers, thin nameplates)
 * PLUS the motorcycle class.
 *
 * GENERATED FILE. Edit scripts/_wave11-body.js and re-run scripts/_gen-wave11.js instead.
 *
 * Every previous wave carried ONE thesis and one prompt. This one carries five, selected per target
 * by `style`, because the evidence lives somewhere different in each case:
 *
 *   'ev' / 'new'  OFFICIAL FIRST. On a vehicle launched 1-3 years ago the forums are thin, and
 *                 demanding forum corroboration is exactly the condition under which an agent starts
 *                 inventing plausible-looking threads. A recall campaign number is a CHECKABLE FACT -
 *                 api.nhtsa.gov returns the make/model/years for a real one and nothing for an
 *                 invented one, and _audit-wave-recalls.js runs that check over the whole wave after.
 *   'volume'      FORUM FIRST. A ten-year-old top-seller has a deep owner community that holds detail
 *                 no government summary captures. These nameplates are not thin because they are
 *                 clean; they are thin because no wave has deepened them yet.
 *   'thin'        FORUM FIRST, and explicitly told the low count is a COVERAGE GAP, not evidence of
 *                 reliability - CX-7 turbo failures and 350Z clutch/CSC failures are notorious.
 *   'moto'        Motorcycle failure surface, and every row is emitted with vehicleType='motorcycle'
 *                 so it can never be counted into the automotive catalog. Make names COLLIDE across
 *                 classes (Suzuki V-Strom vs Suzuki Vitara), which is why the column exists.
 *
 * NO NUMERIC CONFIDENCE GATE. Previous waves dropped anything under 0.70 self-reported confidence.
 * That is unsafe here: self-reported confidence tracks PROMPT WORDING rather than belief (measured
 * 0.70-0.72 vs 0.20-0.33 on identical work), and this wave runs FIVE different prompts, so the
 * numbers are not comparable across targets - a threshold would silently delete the thin and
 * motorcycle results while keeping the EV ones. The gates below are all EVIDENCE gates: real,
 * live citation, at least one non-aggregator source, not a duplicate, citations present. The
 * confidence number is still recorded for the persist step's high/medium/low mapping.
 *
 * ENUM DISCIPLINE: category and severity use the SAME closed sets as the rest of the catalog. The
 * renderer knows 17 categories and high/medium/low only; a wider enum from a research workflow has
 * previously crashed article pages for 39 models. EV and motorcycle concepts must map INTO the
 * existing set, never extend it.
